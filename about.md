My name is Christian Scheid. I am a freelance software developer living in London. My background is mostly in iOS and Mac app development as well as product design. Occasionally I also work on web apps. 

Currently I work on [Caato Time Tracker+ for Mac, iPhone and Apple Watch](http://www.caato.de/timetracker+).
